Welcome to Argeo!
================

ARGeo is an augmented reality mobile app to assist Geologists during fieldwork. 

ARGeo can be used only on Android phones with some hardware requirements. It needs a tablet or smartphone with GPS, gyroscope and compass. These sensors are needed to obtain the location and orientation information that enable the AR features.

In order to install ARGeo, you must follow the next steps:

 1. Copy the apk to the device and install ARGeo.
 2. If you try to start ARGeo, it will suddenly stop... You need to copy the **file** folder to **argeo/bla/bla**. 
> **Note:** We know, it is really tedius. Soon we will upload an upgrade to make this step easier :)

 3. Finally you need to copy the height maps from the location on which ARGeo will be used. You can download heightmaps from LINK.
