Welcome to Argeo!
================

ARGeo is an augmented reality mobile app to assist Geologists during fieldwork. 

With ARGeo you can interact using a virtual terrain that fits the real world. You can add Points Of Interest (POI) over the terrain, as well as more sophisticated features such as Virtual Planes for dipping plane inclination measurement.

 In addition, ARGeo allows to take Virtual Snapshots. With these snapshots, you can record a viewpoint that can be used later on. The virtual elements that are added to the environment are reflected on these snapshots in real-time. For instance, you can edit virtual planes on the fold itself, and visualize the changes as you were on the previously recorded location.

ARGeo can be used only on Android phones with some hardware requirements. It needs a tablet or smartphone with GPS, gyroscope and compass. These sensors are needed to obtain the location and orientation information that enables the AR features.

Installation
-------------
In order to install ARGeo, you must follow the next steps:

 1. Copy the apk to the device and install ARGeo. The apk is located in **/folder**.
 2. If you try to start ARGeo, it will suddenly stop... You need to copy the **/files** folder to the following location on your device **/Android/data/vyglab.argeo/**. 
> **Note:** We know, it is really tedious. Soon we will upload an upgrade to make this step easier :)

 3. Finally you need to copy the height maps from the location on which ARGeo will be used. You can download height maps from **https://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM3/**.

Well that's all for now!

We think it should not be difficult to use ARGeo, however an user manual it is always useful. We will add this and more info about ARGeo soon. 

If you have any question, you can email us to this GitHub user or send us an email to: vyglab@cs.uns.edu.ar

Have a nice **augmented fieldwork**! :)
